- HPF: Hardware Preprocessing Framework (usually ad-hoc inter-mingling of a high-level language and a low-level HDL), the high-level language usually uses basic string processing and is unaware of hardware semantics, basic string processing (behavioral modeling in low-level HDL)
- HGF: Hardware Generation Framework, completely embedding parameteri-zation, static elaboration, test bench generation, and behavioral modeling in a unified high-level “host” language.
- HGSF: Hardware Generation and Simulation Framework, parameterization, static elaboration, test bench generation, behavioral modeling, and a simulation engine are all embedded in a general-purpose high-level language
