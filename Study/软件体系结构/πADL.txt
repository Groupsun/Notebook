Component Split
    Port Input = [Read data until end-of-data reached]
    Port Up = [Output data repeatedly]
    Port Down = [Output data repeatedly]
    Computation = [Repeatedly read data from Input Port, then output into Port Up and Port Down alternetively]

Component UpperCase
    Port Input = [Read data until end-of-data reached]
    Port Output = [Output data repeatedly]
    Computation = [Repeatedly read data from Input Port, then output uppercase into Port Output]

Component Merge
    Port Up = [Read data until end-of-data reached]
    Port Down = [Read data until end-of-data reached]
    Port Output = [Output data repeatedly]
    Computation = [Repeatedly read data from Up Port and Down Port, the output the merge of Up Port and Down Port into Port Output]

Connector Pipe
    Role Source = [Deliver data repeatedly, signaling termination by close]
    Role Sink = [Read data repeatedly, closing at or before end-of-data]
    Glue = [Role Sink received data in the same order delivered by Role Source]
