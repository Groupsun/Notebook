# Some interesting ideas or something else

##  Heterogeneous-ISA and heterogenrous processor

1. Use OpenPiton framework, integrating a small RISC-V core into the OpenPiton framework, which uses a modified OpenSPARC T1 core. This new core names JuxtaPiton, it is the first **open-source, general-purpose, heterogeneous-ISA processor**.

2. Design of a Heterogeneous-ISA chip multiprocessor
